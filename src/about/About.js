                            Hi ðŸ‘‹ Im Sam Rossilli. I'm a budding Systems Engineer. 4th-year student at University of Colorado: Colorado Springs Studying Data Analytics and Systems Engineering.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            I'm an early-career systems engineer and data analyst who is obsessed with improving systems with the help of data.

                            I'm currently studying at the University of Colorado: Colorado Springs for a B.S in Data Analytics and Systems Engineering. I will be joining Amazon as a Software Development Engineer after graduation in June 2022!

                            My education and experience is in model-based systems engineering, software engineering, and data analytics. I have experience with Python, C/C++, Java, and Matlab and with concepts such as Object-oriented programing, the systems engineering life cycle, and the software engineering life cycle.

                            This past summer, I was an intern at USCellular, where I improved my Python skills and expanded my knowledge of real-time networks. I was an intern for the Voice Services group, where I developed a tool to monitor the status of components in the IMS Network.

                            I am open to learning more about positions related to Systems Engineering, Data Analytics, Software Development, or related engineering field.

                        </p>
